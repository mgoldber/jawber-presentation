# JavaScript 101 Workshop

## Mentors
Thanks for helping us mentor our JavaScript workshop, JavaScript 101!

Here is a breakdown of the expectations of being a mentor:

Before the workshop, take a look at the notes at learnjs.hackeryou.com. Please familiarize yourself with the concepts we will be covering.

Please arrive at least 10 minutes before the workshop begins! Participants arrive in waves and it's extremely helpful to have mentors set up and ready to help out.

Please wear a nametag that says your name and that you're a mentor. Nametags will be available for you!

As students arrive, please greet them with a welcoming hello! Walk them into class. Once they are seated, ensure they have access to wifi and notes. We will require students to sign up for a codepen account, so if they arrive early you can help them get sorted with that.

Students are shy! When they arrive please start a conversation with them. Ask them if they've done any coding before, ask why they are interested in coding, tell them about how you got started coding.

As the workshop is in session, please stay seated around different parts of the classroom (please don't just stay at the back of the room!) but keep an eye out for participants who need any help. If you aren't sure of an answer to a participant's question, grab another mentor or the instructor. Often times students will struggle silently, and once you ask them a question they will open up.

When helping a student, stick to the concepts we will cover in the workshop. If a student has a question you know we won't get to answer during the workshop, let them know we won't get to cover it today, but it's a concept that is covered in our other courses.

A lot of students will have questions about our Bootcamp. If you don't feel comfortable answering them, grab the instructor or a HackerYou staff member. If no one is available, give them one of our Growth team member's business cards (Cody or Tarra).

At the start of JavaScript 101, the instructor is going to ask you to introduce yourself with your name, what courses you've taken at HY, and what you like most about learning to code or coding in general! Please think of an answer you feel best represents you.

Most importantly, students **love** hearing about your experience at HackerYou! At the end of the workshop, there's going to be some open time for participants to ask questions. Sharing why you chose HY and what you think makes HY unique are great things to share!


## Instructors

Thanks for teaching with us!

Here is a breakdown of the expectations of instructing this workshop:

Please familiarize yourself with:
- The notes (learnjs.hackeryou.com)
- CodePen
- The project you will build

Teaching with CodePen is a little less user friendly than with a text editor. Because of this, we ask that you sign into HackerYou's CodePen account. Once you open a pen in CodePen, with a paid account you can use "Presentation mode" under the "Change View" menu.

Particularly the zoom is difficult, we would recommend to zoom to 125% in CodePen with Presentation Mode. We've chose CodePen because the students projects will be hosted for them. We think it's exciting for a student to see their work live, and this allows them to share their work as well! Students must verify their account in order to open their Pen in "Live view".

The "exercise" time is meant to be fully guided. The goal is to have a completed project by the end of the workshop! We can ensure students have a great final project if we go through the steps together.

There are times when we don't go into a ton of detail. This is to ensure that there is enough time to get through the content.

As students are arriving, please play some music. Feel free to chat with the mentors, but we also ask you to chat with students as they come in. Students and mentors will rely on you to set the tone of the workshop. Please try to make everyone feel welcome.

A great way to begin the workshop is to ask the group who has some coding experience. It gives you a good reference for who is in the room. Teach to those who have never coded before, review for those with experience is fine! Please be sure to mention as you work through the content that this is just the "tip of the coding iceberg" and that these topics are covered in detail in our part-time and accelerated JavaScript classes.

If you have any questions or comments about the notes, please email <a href="mailto:mark@hackeryou.com">mark@hackeryou.com.</a> If you'd like to request changes, feel free to make a pull request!

## General Flow & What to Expect

There will be at least one HackerYou staff present to sign in the participants. They will have access to the list of participants as well as nametags for them to complete and put on. If you need anything, please let them know!

Every JavaScript 101 has about 3-4 mentors, either current bootcamp students or HY grads that are there to support the participants.

Here's a general flow for JavaScript 101:
- **10-20 minutes before it starts**, participants usually begin to arrive.
- **We strive to have the workshops start on time**, but if there is inclement weather, it may start a couple minutes late to allow participants to arrive. Touch base with the HY staff on-site to get a feel for when you should begin!
- **At the start of JavaScript 101**, an HY staff will open the workshop by giving a brief hello and introducing the instructor. This should be about 5 minutes or less. Afterwards, the instructor will introduce themselves and the mentors with their names, and what classes they've taken at HY and their favourite thing about coding.
- **A 5-10 minute break** should be given around the halfway mark - it is up to the instructor to decide when and for how long.
- **The content should take about two hours to teach**, ~10-15 minutes over is completely okay!
- **After the teachable material is covered**, the same HY staff who opened up the workshop will thank the participants and invite participants to speak to the instructor/mentors about any questions they have about learning to code. If any participants have questions about the bootcamp process, please direct them to the HY staff.

### Thank you!
